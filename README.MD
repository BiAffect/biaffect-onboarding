## üìà Data Analysis Prep

If you're going to work on data analysis of the keyboard dynamics collected by the BiAffect app, please review the following to prepare.

We use Synapse as our data repository, and the `synapseclient` Python package to access and download data. Below are essential resources to get you started:

- [Synapse Python Client Setup](https://python-docs.synapse.org/tutorials/python_client/)  
  Installation and authentication guide for `synapseclient`.

- [Using `synapseutils.syncFromSynapse()`](https://python-docs.synapse.org/reference/synapse_utils/)  
  Reference for downloading files and working with manifests.

- [Entity Types, Annotations, and File Metadata](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Downloading-Data-Programmatically.2003796248.html)  
  Overview of Synapse IDs, files, folders, and how to access metadata and annotations.
